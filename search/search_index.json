An introductory course into Machine Learning using Python for graduate students, post-docs, and research associates in fields related to the Biological Sciences. Course Description 2020-02-24 7:30 Python is one of the most popular contemporary programming languages for data science. It is a powerful and easy to use language without over-complicated syntax. More and more programmers are moving their code to Python which is also widely used for data analytics and machine learning. Throughout the course, we will use Python to introduce students to concepts and best practices in data analytics, data visualization, reproducible science, and machine learning. Students will have a chance to work through examples mainly drawn from biology, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to show the various applications of Python in bioinformatics. Furthermore, students will get used to standard tools in the field such as Conda, Git or Jupyter-Lab. Conda will be used to install software that will be used in the course such as Git and Jupyter. The class will be taught using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code interactively. Git is a version control instrument that will be used throughout the whole course to download and upload assignments and course material from GitHub. The course will be taught interactively with periods of short exercises where students are asked to apply the course material. The course will start with setting up the tools and the computation environment followed by a brief introduction of Python. The Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) and other important packages will be introduced. Finally, the machine learning workflow will be addressed: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, publication-quality visualizations, decomposition, clustering, classification, regression, linear models, ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), artificial neural networks, cross-validation, deployment of machine learning models.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#machine-learning-with-python-for-biology-2020","text":"This website is for the course Machine Learning with Python for Biology held at the University of Calgary in Spring 2020.
