An introductory course into Machine Learning using Python for graduate students, post-docs, and research associates in fields related to the Biological Sciences. Course Description 2020-02-24 7:30 Python is one of the most popular contemporary programming languages for data science. It is a powerful and easy to use language without over-complicated syntax. More and more programmers are moving their code to Python which is also widely used for data analytics and machine learning. Throughout the course, we will use Python to introduce students to concepts and best practices in data analytics, data visualization, reproducible science, and machine learning. Students will have a chance to work through examples mainly drawn from biology, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to show the various applications of Python in bioinformatics. Furthermore, students will get used to standard tools in the field such as Conda, Git or Jupyter-Lab. Conda will be used to install software that will be used in the course such as Git and Jupyter. The class will be taught using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code interactively. Git is a version control instrument that will be used throughout the whole course to download and upload assignments and course material from GitHub. The course will be taught interactively with periods of short exercises where students are asked to apply the course material. The course will start with setting up the tools and the computation environment followed by a brief introduction of Python. The Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) and other important packages will be introduced. Finally, the machine learning workflow will be addressed: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, publication-quality visualizations, decomposition, clustering, classification, regression, linear models, ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), artificial neural networks, cross-validation, deployment of machine learning models.

Classes will take place Wednesdays from 10am to 1pm starting from May 6th 2020 until June 24th. Where will the classes take place? The classroom will be BI211 except for June 17th. On June 17th the class will take place in room BI249. What are the course requirements? Students should have some basic experience with programming (Python, R, C, Java, etc). Students are required to sign up for a GitHub and GitHub-Classroom accounts. Students need to bring their own computers where they have the right to install additional software with at least 8GB RAM and 1GB free disc space. It is recommended to install Python using Miniconda before the class starts. Familiarity with Git, GitHub, Python, Bash (Command Line), Jupyter-Lab is beneficial. Will the course be graded? The course will be graded by attendance, weekly assignments, and a final capstone project. Is it possible to audit the course instead of taking on a graded basis? What is the expected commitment of the assignments? The assignments are expected to take approximately one hour.","title":"Q/A"},{"location":"qa/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"qa/#when-will-the-classes-take-place","text":"Classes will take place Wednesdays from 10am to 1pm starting from May 6th 2020 until June 24th.","title":"When will the classes take place?"},{"location":"qa/#where-will-the-classes-take-place","text":"The classroom will be BI211 except for June 17th.
