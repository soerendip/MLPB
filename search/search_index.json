An introductory course into Machine Learning using Python for graduate students, post-docs, and research associates in fields related to the Biological Sciences. Introduction Machine Learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In this class you will learn the basics of building ML pipelines using Python . We will cover data preparation, exploratory data analysis, statistics, visualization, feature engineering, model building, cross-validation, classification and regression. Furthermore, you will be introduced to some of the standard tools and concepts in the field such as reproducible science, version control and virtual environments. Course Content Students will have a chance to work through examples mainly drawn from biology, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to show the various applications of Python in bioinformatics. Furthermore, students will get used to standard tools in the field such as Conda , Git or JupyterLab . Conda will be used to install software that will be used in the course such as Git and Jupyter. The class will be taught using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code interactively. Git is a version control instrument that will be used throughout the whole course to download and upload assignments and course material from GitHub. The course will be taught interactively with periods of short exercises where students are asked to apply the course material. The course will start with setting up the tools and the computation environment followed by a brief introduction of Python. The Python Data Analysis Library ( Pandas ), Scikit-learn and other important packages will be introduced. Finally, the machine learning workflow will be addressed: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, publication-quality visualizations, decomposition, clustering, classification, regression, linear models, ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), artificial neural networks, cross-validation and the deployment of machine learning models. Why Python? Python is one of the most popular contemporary programming languages for data science. It is a powerful and easy to use language without over-complicated syntax. More and more programmers are moving their code to Python which is also widely used for data analytics and machine learning. Date and Time Classes will take place Wednesdays from 10am to 1pm starting from May 6th 2020 until June 24th . The classroom will be BI211 except for June 17th. On June 17th the class will take place in room BI249 . More Information More information about the course is available in the Q/A section . Registration Please, help us assessing the level of your current knowledge by filling out the poll . Then, for registration, please write an email to kbarron@ucalgary.ca . Indicate if you are student, Postdoc, etc and if you want to join the course on a graded basis or audit.

Classes will take place Wednesdays from 10am to 1pm starting from May 6th 2020 until June 24th. Where will the classes take place? The classroom will be BI211 except for June 17th. On June 17th the class will take place in room BI249. What are the course requirements? Students should have some basic experience with programming (Python, R, C, Java, etc). Students are required to sign up for a GitHub and GitHub-Classroom accounts. Students need to bring their own computers where they have the right to install additional software with at least 8GB RAM and 1GB free disc space. It is recommended to install Python using Miniconda before the class starts. Familiarity with Git, GitHub, Python, Bash (Command Line), Jupyter-Lab is beneficial. Students have to register before they can attend or audit the course. A basic understanding of Linear Algebra (Vector and Matix calculus) is assumed. Will the course be graded? The course will be graded by attendance, weekly assignments, and a final capstone project. Is it possible to audit the course instead of taking it on a graded basis? Auditing privileges are extended to students who have been admitted as a Degree, Visiting or Open Studies student. Auditing students participate in classroom activities however they may not be able to complete lab or tutorial components of a course. Students do not complete any exam or course assignments nor receive a grade for the course(s) they are auditing. Students may be limited to the courses they can audit due to enrolment pressures. In case you are not sure please contact Karen Barron ( kbarron@ucalgary.ca ). What is the expected commitment of the assignments? The assignments are expected to take approximately one hour.
