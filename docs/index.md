# Machine Learning with Python for Biology

This website is for the course Machine Learning with Python for Biology held at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca) in Spring 2020. An introductory course into Machine Learning using Python for graduate students, post-docs, and research associates in fields related to the Biological Sciences.

## Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In this class you will learn the basics of building a ML pipeline using [Python](https://www.python.org/). We will cover data preparation, exploratory data analysis, statistics, visualization, feature engineering, model building, cross-validation, classification and regression. Furthermore, you will be introduced to some of the standard tools and concepts in the field such as reproducible science, version control and virtual environments.

## Course Description
Students will have a chance to work through examples mainly drawn from biology, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to show the various applications of Python in bioinformatics.
 
Furthermore, students will get used to standard tools in the field such as [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Conda will be used to install software that will be used in the course such as Git and Jupyter. The class will be taught using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code interactively. Git is a version control instrument that will be used throughout the whole course to download and upload assignments and course material from GitHub. The course will be taught interactively with periods of short exercises where students are asked to apply the course material.
 
The course will start with setting up the tools and the computation environment followed by a brief introduction of Python. The Python Data Analysis Library ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) and other important packages will be introduced. Finally, the machine learning workflow will be addressed: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, publication-quality visualizations, decomposition, clustering, classification, regression, linear models, ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), artificial neural networks, cross-validation, deployment of machine learning models.

## Why Python
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is one of the most popular contemporary programming languages for data science. It is a powerful and easy to use language without over-complicated syntax. More and more programmers are moving their code to Python which is also widely used for data analytics and machine learning. Throughout the course, we will use Python to introduce students to concepts and best practices in data analytics, data visualization, reproducible science, and machine learning. 


### Location and time
- Classes will take place **Wednesdays from 10am to 1pm** starting from **May 6th 2020 until June 24th**.
- The classroom will be **BI211** except for June 17th.
